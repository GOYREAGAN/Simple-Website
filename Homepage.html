                            I started learning to code when i was 16 years of age<br>
                            My best friend introduced me to the world of programming<br>
                            At first my real definition of success was getting a degree in Engineering<br>
                            I got inspired to be a Chemical Engineer by Arthur D. Little who  developed<br>
